### 🎚️ Transcription Profiles

Quick-switch between language, prompt, and LLM post-processing presets with dedicated shortcuts: swithc currently active profile or assign each profile its own hotkey!

#### What Are Profiles?

Profiles let you create different transcription configurations and switch between them instantly. Perfect for:

- **Multilingual users** — Switch between English, Russian, Finnish, etc.
- **Different use cases** — One profile for dictation, another for code comments
- **Translation workflows** — Speak in one language, output in another + auto switch language with Windows language!
- **Everything you can imagine!** — Serioulsy, you can invent so many uses!

#### Profile Settings

![Profile Settings](Promo/profiles.png)
#### LLM Post-Processing Override

Each profile can override the global LLM post-processing settings:

- **Enable/Disable** — Turn LLM processing on/off per profile
- **Custom Prompt** — Use a different prompt than the global one
- **Custom Model** — Use a different LLM model per profile

**Example:** Create a "Finnish Translation" profile that takes any language input and outputs Finnish text via LLM.

#### The `${output}` Variable

When writing LLM prompts, use `${output}` as a placeholder for the transcribed text:

```
Translate this to Finnish: ${output}
```

**How it works:**

1. You speak → "Hello, how are you?"
2. STT transcribes → "Hello, how are you?"
3. `${output}` is replaced → "Translate this to Finnish: Hello, how are you?"
4. LLM processes → "Hei, mitä kuuluu?"

#### Shortcuts

Assign key combination to following actions:

| Shortcut                        | Action                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Main Transcribe**   | Transcribe using the active profile              |
| **Cycle Profile**               | Switch to the next active profile in cycle              |
| **Per-Profile Shortcuts**       | Each profile can have its own dedicated shortcut if you don'w want to cycle profiles but use all at once |


#### Default Profile

The "Default Profile" uses your global settings (Settings → Speech). It cannot be deleted but can be customized or set as active.

**Setup:** Settings → Speech → Transcription Profiles

### 🤖 AI Replace Selection

Voice-controlled text editing — select text, speak instruction, get AI-transformed result.

- Select code → say "add error handling" → improved code replaces selection
- Select paragraph → say "make it shorter" → condensed version
- Empty field + "no selection" mode → say "write a greeting email" → generated text
- Works in any Windows application

![AI Replace](Promo/ai-replace.gif)

In the demonstration above, first I ask to solve the mathematical task, and then to translate text to finish. 

**Setup:** Settings → Advanced → AI Replace Settings

### 📤 Send to ChatGPT/Claude

Voice-to-AI bridge via [AivoRelay Connector](https://github.com/MaxITService/AivoRelay-relay) browser extension.

- **Easy app-driven setup** — AivoRelay can unpack/export the extension right from the app.
- **Generated password** — The app can create the connector password for you automatically.
- **CORS-ready local bridge** — The local connector flow is configured for secure browser use without extra manual setup.

![How it works](Promo/How_it_works.png)

| Mode                   | Input                  | What ChatGPT receives     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Voice only**         | Speak your question    | Your transcribed question |
| **Voice + Selection**  | Speak + selected text  | Question with context     |
| **Voice + Screenshot** | Speak + screen capture | Question with image       |

**Examples:**

- Say "what is recursion" → ChatGPT gets your question
- Select error log, say "why is this failing" → ChatGPT gets question + the log
- Capture chart, say "explain this" → ChatGPT gets question + screenshot

> ⚠️ **Requires:** [AivoRelay Connector](https://github.com/MaxITService/AivoRelay-relay) Chrome extension



### 📁 Transcribe Audio Files (with diarization for supporting API providers)

Drag and drop audio files to get a transcript.

- Supports WAV, MP3, OGG, M4A, FLAC
- Outputs Text, SRT (Subtitles), or VTT
- Uses your local or cloud models
- Deepgram can label different speakers in multi-speaker recordings

**Usage:** Settings → Transcribe Audio File

### ✏️ Text Replacement

Automatically fix transcription errors and apply formatting rules.

| Feature                 | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Find & Replace**      | Simple text substitution with special character support (`\n`, `\t`) |
| **Case Insensitive**    | Toggle to match "Hello" and "hello" as the same                      |
| **Regular Expressions** | Advanced pattern matching with capture group support (`$1`, `$2`)    |

**Examples:**

- Fix typos: `teh` → `the`
- Remove repeated words: `\b(\w+)\s+\1\b` → `$1` (regex)
- Add paragraph breaks: `.\n` → `.\n\n`

Applied after LLM post-processing, so you get the final word on the output!

**Setup:** Settings → Text Replace

### 🔠 Custom Words (Fuzzy Matching)

Automatically recombine and fix complex terms split by speech-to-text (e.g., "Chat G P T" → "ChatGPT") using fuzzy n-gram matching.

**Setup:** Settings → Text Replace → Custom Words

### 🧹 Audio Clean-Up & Smart Prompts

Automatically filter out filler words and stutters from transcriptions. Enhance LLM templates with dynamic context variables like `${current_app}` and `${time_local}`!

### 🔠 Smart Decapitalize After Edit

Avoid unwanted capitalization when continuing a sentence after a manual correction.

![Smart Decapitalize](Promo/Backspace-handling.png)

AivoRelay passively monitors your "edit" key (default: **Backspace**). If you press it to correct a transcription and then resume speaking, the next inserted text chunk will automatically start with a **lowercase** letter. This prevents the system from starting a new "sentence" with a capital letter when you are actually in the middle of a sentence.

- **Non-Blocking** — Uses a passive listener, so your edit keys work exactly as usual.
- **One-Shot Trigger** — The logic fires only once after a correction and then resets.
- **Configurable Timeout** — Set how long the "resume" window remains active after your edit.
- **Real-time Support** — Works seamlessly with Soniox Live transcription and standard modes.

**Setup:** Settings → Text Replace → Decapitalize After Manual Edit

### ☁️ Cloud STT Option

Use Groq, Deepgram, or other OpenAI-compatible APIs — or keep using local Whisper. Your choice!

- No GPU? Use fast cloud APIs
- Have a powerful GPU? Run locally for privacy
- Switch between providers anytime

**Setup:** Settings → Advanced → Transcription Provider

---
### 🗣️ Voice Command Center (Dangerous! Do not use)

Execute PowerShell scripts with your voice. Pre write scriopts... or make LMM write them on the fly (confirmation dialog window appears, you can cancel)

- Say "lock computer" → Locks Windows
- Say "open notepad" → Opens Notepad
- **Somewhat safe:** Always shows confirmation before running
- **Smart:** If no command matches, use AI to generate a script on the fly (e.g. "open chrome and go to youtube")

**Setup:** Settings → Voice Command Center

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Download from [Releases](https://github.com/MaxITService/AIVORelay/releases)
2. Install and run AivoRelay
3. Press `Ctrl+F8` — hold to record, release to transcribe!
