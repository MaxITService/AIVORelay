# Branching Status
Branch tags: #branch/main #branch/release-microsoft-store

Operational note: this file is a quick reference, not the sole source of truth for the next propagation start point.
Before starting a new `main` -> branch sync, verify the target branch directly with git history (`git log`, `git cherry`, and if needed `git reflog`).

## release/microsoft-store

Last synced commit from `main`: `2a495378` — chore: bump version to 1.0.45.
Maintenance rule: after a successful `main` -> `release/microsoft-store` propagation, update this main-copy cursor and the `release/microsoft-store` worktree copy together.
Note: the cursor always points to the last propagated `main` state reflected in branch content, not to a docs-only cursor-update commit itself.
Alignment note: runtime and 1.0.45 release preparation propagated through the cursor above. Main-only code notes, testing documentation, and standalone frontend tests from 7366d7c5 are excluded; earlier test-only 8498faaa remains excluded. Existing documentation differences are preserved. Store config, workflows, updater, and AVX2 rules are preserved. The Store lockfile app version was updated independently; builds/tests were not run locally. Release notes and What's New retain all 1.0.44 highlights because the last published version is 1.0.43.
Sync rule: for this branch, source commits come from `main` only.
Propagation scope rule: for Microsoft Store Edition propagation, bring over the intended `main` commit set in order unless a commit is store-incompatible. Default exclusions are self-update/auto-update changes and AVX512-only changes; AVX2 is allowed.

## integration/cuda (frozen)

Frozen branch head: `ac2ee48a` — docs(sync): record 1.0.22 CUDA propagation.
Keep its existing build documentation and release infrastructure intact, but do not propagate `main` updates into this branch unless the user explicitly unfreezes it.

## integration/combined (frozen)

Frozen branch head: `10d35c4f` — docs(sync): record 1.0.22 combined propagation.
Keep its existing build documentation and release infrastructure intact, but do not propagate `main` updates into this branch unless the user explicitly unfreezes it.
